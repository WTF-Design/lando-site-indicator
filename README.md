# Lando site indicator
User script for easy visual distinction between production and Lando dev sites via a hot pink window border and a favicon overlay.

Written for and tested in Firefox/ViolentMonkey.

[Install/Update](https://github.com/WTF-Design/lando-site-indicator/raw/main/script.user.js)

Lando logo is the property of [Lando System, Inc.](https://lando.dev) and is embedded in and used from the user script meta data block in order to keep things as lean and self-contained as possible.
